# Web Workers

## Project Description
This project showcases the use of Web Workers to enhance the performance of data processing tasks in a web application. The web page includes three buttons with distinct functionalities:
1. **Process Large Data with Web Worker:** Demonstrates the utilization of a Web Worker to perform a computationally intensive task (calculating the sum of a large number) in the background, preventing UI freezes.
2. **Process Large Data without Web Worker:** Performs the same calculation without using a Web Worker, highlighting potential UI freezes during resource-intensive operations.
3. **Print Hi!:** Adds a simple interaction feature by appending "HI !!" to the page when clicked.

## How to Run the Project Locally
To experience the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Interact with the buttons to observe the different behaviors associated with Web Workers and the UI responsiveness.

## Performance Findings
The project emphasizes the performance benefits achieved by using a Web Worker for computationally intensive tasks. Key observations include:
- **Parallel Execution:** The "Process Large Data with Web Worker" button demonstrates parallel execution, allowing simultaneous interactions such as clicking "Print Hi!" without UI freezes.
- **Improved Responsiveness:** The UI remains responsive during the calculation process when using a Web Worker. In contrast, clicking "Process Large Data without Web Worker" may result in a temporary screen freeze.

## Challenges Faced and Solutions
### Challenges:
1. **Web Worker Usage:** Understanding how to effectively integrate and utilize Web Workers.
2. **Message Passing:** Sending and receiving messages between the main thread and the Web Worker.

### Solutions:
1. **Documentation Reference:** Utilized the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) Web Workers documentation and online tutorials to grasp the fundamentals.
2. **Message Passing Techniques:** Implemented the `postMessage` method for data transmission and leveraged the `onmessage` event handler for seamless communication.
